MOS (Multiprogramming Operating System) Simulation
Overview
This project is a simulation of a Memory Operating System (MOS) that demonstrates core operating system concepts including:

Process management (PCB, context switching)

Memory management (paging, address translation)

Interrupt handling (timer, I/O, program errors)

Job scheduling

System calls (read, write, terminate)

The simulation implements a virtual machine with CPU, memory, and I/O device emulation to execute simple programs loaded from an input file.

Key Features
Process Management
Process Control Blocks (PCBs) track process state

Context switching between processes

Ready queue for process scheduling

Time slicing for multiprogramming

Memory Management
Paged virtual memory system

Address translation (VA â†’ PA)

Page fault handling

Frame allocation and deallocation

Interrupt Handling
Priority-based interrupt vector table

Timer interrupts

Program interrupts (invalid opcodes, operands)

System call interrupts (read, write, terminate)

I/O Operations
Simulated input/output devices

Buffered I/O operations

Device interrupt handling
